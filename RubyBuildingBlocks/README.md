# Basic Ruby programming.
---
### 
This repo contains some of my first Ruby projects (caesar, substring, stock_picker) and a few months younger bubble_sort
(which is my first project after a long break from Ruby programming). Caesar and bubble_sort have been cleaned a bit, but
I'm keeping substring and stock_picker as they are - ugly, unprofessional and simply poor - for archival purposes.

As of 12.11.2020 (DD-MM-YYYY for Americans) visit Hangman (or Demagog in side projects repo) in order to see a more up to
date display of my coding skills.
