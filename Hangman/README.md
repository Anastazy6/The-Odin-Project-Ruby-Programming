# Ruby Hangman

## The Odin Project - **PROJECT: FILE I/O AND SERIALIZATION**

---
This is my implementation of the Hangman game.

Usage: ruby hangman.rb

---
Includes the ability to change settings and load them every time you start a new game.

### Required gems:
- pry (though you might just remove the require 'pry' statement from hangman.rb)
- colorize
